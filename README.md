# SEO-Optimization-LSI-keywords-generation-using-SVD-Classification


The objective of the project was to identify the best marketing SEO keywords for a website using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). The output from multiple search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing) that uses different page ranking algorithms was crawled and given as the data input to produce the optimized LSI Keywords. LSI identifies the relationship between the words beyond the keywords or synonyms in a string. The project used SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to cluster the related information and reduce the dimensionality to produce the optimal ranking of keywords.
